# TENSOR Core Graph Authoring Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook defines how to author and review the Core graph as an investigation backbone.

Core remains investigation-semantic only:
- No business workflow state
- No ticket/case management semantics
- No tool-specific execution steps
- No vendor-specific operational playbook logic (implemented in overlays)

## Core vs Overlay Contract

Core provides guard rails and a shared technical language for investigations; overlays implement
business process and product/tool execution detail on top of Core.

Authoring and review MUST follow: `standards/core-vs-overlay-contract.md`.

Core is a neutral backplane:
- Core standardizes investigation semantics and deterministic routing primitives.
- Overlays (vendor/org/extension layers) define concrete investigative execution detail.

## Canonical Sources
Core graph content is authored from structured source files:
- `drafts/core/source/nodes.jsonl`
- `drafts/core/source/edges.jsonl`
- `drafts/core/source/entry_nodes.json`

Build output is generated via:
- `python3 scripts/build_core_graph_from_source.py --version <VER>`

Quality reports are generated via:
- `python3 scripts/lint_core_graph_quality.py --version <VER>`
  - Emits graph-quality, coverage-matrix, and math-assurance reports.
  - Refreshes latest pointer and history artifacts for math assurance.
  - Evaluates publish gates and fails when release thresholds are missed.

## Node Authoring Model
Required node fields:
- `id`
- `text`
- `label`
- `category`
- `archetype`

Optional node fields:
- `extensions`

### Category
Allowed Core categories:
- `Application`
- `Cloud`
- `Email`
- `File`
- `Host`
- `Identity`
- `Network`

### Archetype
Allowed archetypes:
- `detect`
- `validate`
- `classify`
- `scope`
- `correlate`
- `attribute`
- `impact`
- `terminal`

`terminal` in Core means route termination for a hypothesis path, not case closure/business workflow completion.

## Edge Authoring Model
Required edge fields:
- `id`
- `source`
- `target`
- `decision`

Optional edge fields:
- `label`
- `extensions`

Edge id format:
- `Q<source>-<decision>-Q<target>`

Allowed decisions:
- `yes`
- `no`
- `unknown`

## Backbone Rules
- Core graph must be a DAG (acyclic).
- Every non-terminal node has exactly three outgoing edges:
  - one `yes`
  - one `no`
  - one `unknown`
- Terminal nodes have zero outgoing edges.
- For each non-terminal node, each decision maps to exactly one target.
- Every node must be reachable from at least one entry node.
- `entryNodeIds` must include at least one valid entry node.
- Entry sets are intentionally flexible; overlays may define additional/dynamic entry signals.
- Semantic routing guardrails:
  - `yes` edges must preserve forward investigative logic (`same archetype` or `next archetype` only).
  - `yes` edges from `detect` and `validate` must stay within the same domain (no early-stage domain jumps on positive assertions).

## Coverage and Scale Guidance
- Node and edge counts are intentionally not fixed.
- Expand the graph to the size needed for investigation quality and breadth.
- Keep all seven domains represented with meaningful coverage.
- Cross-domain edge ratio: >= 25%

## Fan-In Constraints
- Default max fan-in (non-terminal nodes): 8
- Exception max fan-in (non-terminal nodes): 12
- Terminal max fan-in (sink nodes): 24
- Non-terminal exceptions must be listed in `entry_nodes.json` under `fanInExceptionNodeIds`

## Text Quality Rules
Node labels must:
- Be short and graph-readable.
- Start with the node domain in the form `<Domain>:` (for example: `Email:`).
- Avoid numeric template labels (for example: `Email detect 12`).

Node text must:
- Be objective and evidence-focused
- Be phrased as a question ending with `?`
- Avoid workflow/tool/process language
- Avoid incident-type or case-typing language (incident naming belongs in overlays)

Forbidden examples in Core text:
- `open a ticket`
- `escalate to`
- `run query in`
- `click dashboard`

## Release Workflow
1. Author source files under `drafts/core/source/`.
2. Build graph artifacts.
3. Run quality lint and generate reports.
4. Update schema snapshot/version when required changes are introduced.
5. Update `releases/manifest.json` and latest pointers.
6. Regenerate checksums.
7. Run release contract validator.

## Artifacts Required Per Release
- Graph artifact:
  - `releases/core/graphs/v<VER>/tensor.core.graph.json`
- Schema artifact:
  - `releases/core/schemas/v<VER>/tensor.core.schema.json`
- Reports:
  - `releases/core/reports/v<VER>/graph-quality.md`
  - `releases/core/reports/v<VER>/graph-quality.json`
  - `releases/core/reports/v<VER>/coverage-matrix.md`
  - `releases/core/reports/v<VER>/coverage-matrix.json`
  - `releases/core/reports/v<VER>/math-assurance.md`
  - `releases/core/reports/v<VER>/math-assurance.json`
- Monitoring artifacts:
  - `releases/core/reports/latest/math-assurance.md`
  - `releases/core/reports/latest/math-assurance.json`
  - `releases/core/reports/history/math-assurance-history.md`
  - `releases/core/reports/history/math-assurance-history.json`

## Publish Gates
Math assurance includes release-level publish gates under:
- `monitoring.publishGates.allPassed`
- `monitoring.publishGates.failedGateIds`
- `monitoring.publishGates.gates[]`

Current gate families include:
- Structural invariants (DAG, reachability, branch totality)
- Routing quality (cross-domain pivots, centralization)
- Robustness (targeted reachability under node removal)
- Information quality (no negative information gain)
- Composite optimization score floor

Gate outcomes are tracked per release in:
- `releases/core/reports/history/math-assurance-history.json`

## Pre-v1 Versioning Exception
For approved pre-v1 releases, a full node-id reindex may be shipped without a major version bump when explicitly authorized in release notes.
